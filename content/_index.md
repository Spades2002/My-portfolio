# Staines Rajith

Graduate Robotics, Mechatronics and Control Engineer

## About Me

As a graduate in Robotics, Mechatronics, and Control Engineering from Loughborough University, I am passionate about solving complex technical challenges and driving innovation across diverse industries. My academic background has provided me with a solid foundation in control systems, automation, and artificial intelligence, while also equipping me with analytical skills that enable me to optimise processes and enhance system performance.

During my internship at First Quantum Minerals, I gained valuable hands-on experience managing automation systems and optimising PLCs in a dynamic industrial environment. This practical exposure deepened my understanding of real-world applications of automation and control, enhancing my problem-solving abilities and adaptability.

Beyond my academic and professional experiences, I am deeply fascinated by the transformative potential of emerging technologies, particularly in robotics and autonomous systems. From my early interest in self-driving cars and precision rocket landings to my undergraduate projects, such as designing a control system for an autonomous drone used in infrastructure inspection, I have been driven to explore how these technologies can address real-world challenges.

My ambition extends beyond control systemsâ€”I am eager to contribute to sectors where automation, artificial intelligence, and data-driven solutions can improve efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. Whether optimising trading operations or enhancing infrastructure reliability, I am committed to applying my technical expertise to develop innovative solutions that make a tangible impact.

I thrive in collaborative environments where continuous learning and growth are encouraged. My ability to approach challenges with analytical rigour, combined with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, positions me well to contribute meaningfully in dynamic and fast-paced industries. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to applying my skills to drive innovation and operational excellence.
